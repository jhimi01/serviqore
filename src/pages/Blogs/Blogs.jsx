              A well-known furniture warehouse located in a suburban area in

              At 1:30 AM EST on a Sunday, a security guard on duty at a
              warehouse reported a concerning sightingâ€”a white van parked at the
              premises without a license plate. Given the warehouse's history of
              theft incidents, including the recent loss of catalytic converters
              valued at $30,000, immediate action was imperative to mitigate
              potential risks.
